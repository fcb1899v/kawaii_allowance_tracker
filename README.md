## 📋 Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.47.0+ (required by Android Gradle Plugin 9: earlier versions
  force the Kotlin Gradle Plugin onto modules that AGP 9 compiles itself)
- Dart 3.13.0+
- Android Studio / Xcode
- Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Analytics)

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sweet_easy_pocket
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Environment Variables Setup
Create `assets/.env` file and configure required environment variables:
```env
IOS_BANNER_UNIT_ID="your-ios-banner-id"
ANDROID_BANNER_UNIT_ID="your-android-banner-id"
IOS_BANNER_TEST_ID="your-ios-test-banner-id"
ANDROID_BANNER_TEST_ID="your-android-test-banner-id"
```

### 4. Firebase Configuration
1. Create a Firebase project
2. Enable Firestore, Authentication, and Analytics
3. Place `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)
4. These files are tracked here. The Gradle plugin fails the Android build
   without the json, and the Xcode project lists the plist in its Resources
   phase, so excluding them only broke fresh clones. They carry the same
   identifiers as `lib/firebase_options.dart`, which ship inside the app.
   Real secrets stay out: the keystore and the environment file

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
# Android
flutter run

# iOS (Swift Package Manager: there is no Podfile to install)
flutter run
```

## 🔧 Development

### Code Analysis
```bash
flutter analyze
```

### Run Tests

There are none. The `flutter create` counter test was removed on 2026-09-02
because it asserted on a widget this app does not have and could only ever fail,
which made a red `flutter test` indistinguishable from a real failure.

`flutter analyze` is the check that runs clean and is expected to stay that way.

```bash
flutter analyze   # expected: No issues found!
```

### Build
```bash
# Android APK
flutter build apk

# Android App Bundle
flutter build appbundle

# iOS
flutter build ios
```
